<h2> Summary </h2> 
<p align="justify"> Over the past decade, information retrieval community has
deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose
queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion,
reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations.
However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized
tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together
various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and
structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various
application scenarios where effective verbose query processing
can make a significant difference.

<p align="justify"> Our tutorial is suitable for information retrieval researchers and
practitioners alike. We will cover both the theory of retrieval methods that
deal with verbose queries, as well as provide examples of their practical applications.
For the newcomers to the field, the tutorial will give the a complete picture
of the current work, introduce important research topics in this
field, and hopefully inspire to learn more.

<p align="justify"> The tutorial will be held as a full-day tutorial at the SIGIR 2015 conference in Santiago, Chile on Sunday, August 9th, 2015.
See <a href="http://www.sigir2015.org/content/tutorials">SIGIR 2015 tutorial page</a> for more details regarding exact time and location.

<h2> Book </h2>
The tutorial is accompanied by a survey on the topic of information retrieval with verbose queries. The survey is published in the Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval series
and is currently available <a href="http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/INR-050">here</a>. Currently, the print edition is available at a special discount price to SIGIR attendees (use
the discount code 198756).
